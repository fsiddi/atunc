# atunc

atunc is a simple macOS command line utility that allows recording audio from a single input 
device onto a single .wav file on the disk. The software is meant as a companion for the 
"Push to talk" Blender extension, which allows to record audio input within the Blender VSE.

Usage:

```
  --list-devices                  List all audio devices in JSON format
  --device-id <id>                Specify the device ID to use for recording
  --output-path <path>            Specify the output path for the WAV file
```
